" To use this file, source it in your own personal .vimrc file (``source
" <filename>``) or, if you don't have a .vimrc file, you can just symlink to it
" (``ln -s <this file> ~/.vimrc``).  All options are protected by autocmds
" (read below for an explanation of the command) so blind sourcing of this file
" is safe and will not affect your settings for non-Python or non-C files.
"
"
" All setting are protected by 'au' ('autocmd') statements.  Only files ending
" in .py or .pyw will trigger the Python settings while files ending in *.c,*.cpp or
" *.h will trigger the C settings.  This makes the file "safe" in terms of only
" adjusting settings for Python and C files.
"
" Only basic settings needed to enforce the style guidelines are set.
" Some suggested options are listed but commented out at the end of this file.


" Number of spaces to use for an indent.
" This will affect Ctrl-T and 'autoindent'.
" Python: 4 spaces
" C: 8 spaces (pre-existing files) or 4 spaces (new files)
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.py,*pyw set shiftwidth=4
au BufRead *.c,*.cpp,*.h set shiftwidth=4
au BufNewFile *.c,*.cpp,*.h set shiftwidth=4

" Number of spaces that a pre-existing tab is equal to.
" For the amount of space used for a new tab use shiftwidth.
" Python: 8
" C: 8
au BufRead,BufNewFile *py,*pyw,*.c,*.cpp,*.h set tabstop=8

" Replace tabs with the equivalent number of spaces.
" Also have an autocmd for Makefiles since they require hard tabs.
" Python: yes
" C: no
" Makefile: no
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.py,*.pyw set expandtab
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.c,*.cpp,*.h set expandtab
au BufRead,BufNewFile Makefile* set noexpandtab

" Use the below highlight group when displaying bad whitespace is desired
highlight BadWhitespace ctermbg=red guibg=red

" Display tabs at the beginning of a line in Python mode as bad.
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.py,*.pyw,*.c,*.cpp,*.h match BadWhitespace /^\t\+/
" Make trailing whitespace be flagged as bad.
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.py,*.pyw,*.c,*.cpp,*.h match BadWhitespace /\s\+$/

" Wrap text after a certain number of characters
" Python: 79 
" C: 79
" au BufRead,BufNewFile *.py,*.pyw,*.c,*.cpp,*.h set textwidth=79

" Turn off settings in 'formatoptions' relating to comment formatting.
" - c : do not automatically insert the comment leader when wrapping based on
"    'textwidth'
" - o : do not insert the comment leader when using 'o' or 'O' from command mode
" - r : do not insert the comment leader when hitting <Enter> in insert mode
" Python: not needed
" C: prevents insertion of '*' at the beginning of every line in a comment
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.c,*.cpp,*.h set formatoptions-=c formatoptions-=o formatoptions-=r

" Use UNIX (\n) line endings.
" Only used for new files so as to not force existing files to change their
" line endings.
" Python: yes
" C: yes
au BufNewFile *.py,*.pyw,*.c,*.cpp,*.h set fileformat=unix

" The following section contains suggested settings.  While in no way required
" to meet coding standards, they are helpful.

" Set the default file encoding to UTF-8: ``
set encoding=utf-8

" Puts a marker at the beginning of the file to differentiate between UTF and
" UCS encoding (WARNING: can trick shells into thinking a text file is actually
" a binary file when executing the text file): ``set bomb``

" For full syntax highlighting:
let python_highlight_all=1
syntax on

" Automatically indent based on file type: 
filetype indent on
" Keep indentation level from previous line: 
set autoindent
colors adaryn
" Folding based on indentation: 
"set foldmethod=indent
